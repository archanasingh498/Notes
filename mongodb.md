* A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. 
MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents.

* The advantages of using documents are:

1.Documents (i.e. objects) correspond to native data types in many programming languages.
2.Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for expensive joins.
3.Dynamic schema supports fluent polymorphism.

**collections**
MongoDB stores documents in collections. Collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

**key features of mongodb**
* high performance  
* rich query languages 
* high availability
* horizontal scalability
* support for multiple storage engines
